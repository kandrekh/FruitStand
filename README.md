Create an application wit a form that resembles Figure 3-48. The PictureBox controls display the images of four fruites (a banana, an apple, an orange, an a pear) and each fruit's price-per-pound. You can find these images in the Chap03 folder of the Student Sample Programs.

The application keeps a total of the fruit that is purchased. When the application starts, the total displayed should be zero. Each time the user clicks one of te PictureBoxes, the price for a pound of that fruit should be added to the total, and the total should be displayed. When the user clicks the Reset button, the total should be reset to zero.
